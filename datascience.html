        <h2>What is Data Science?</h2>
        <p>Data science is the field of study that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It combines various disciplines such as statistics, machine learning, data analysis, and visualization to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and correlations in data. Data science plays a crucial role in decision-making, forecasting, and problem-solving across industries, driving innovation and enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions.</p>

        <p>So briefly it can be said that Data Science involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Statistics, computer science, mathematics</li>
            <li>Data cleaning and formatting</li>
            <li>Data visualization</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><u>Why Data Science?</u></h2>
        <p>So before jumping into the complete Roadmap of Data Science, one should have a clear goal in their mind about why they want to learn Data Science. Is it for the phrase <span class="highlight">“The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century“</span>? Is it for your college academic projects? or is it for your long-term career? or do you want to switch your career to the data scientist world? So first make a clear goal.</p>

        <p>Why do you want to learn Data Science? For example, if you want to learn Data Science for your college Academic projects then it’s enough to just learn the beginner things in Data Science. Similarly, if you want to build your long-term career then you should learn professional or advanced things also. You have to cover all the prerequisite things in detail. So it’s in your hand and it’s your decision why you want to learn Data Science.</p>

        <h2><u>What Does a Data Scientist Do?</u></h2>
        <p>A Data Scientist gathers and analyzes complex data to guide business decisions. They collect, clean, and explore data, develop machine learning models, and deploy them for real-world use.</p>

        <p>Data Scientists also monitor and maintain models, communicate findings to non-technical stakeholders, and collaborate across teams to align with organizational goals.</p>

        <h2><u>Why Become a Data Scientist?</u></h2>
        <p>In the global landscape, data is the new oil, driving innovation and reshaping industries. Organizations crave skilled professionals to extract insights from this vast information ocean, and here’s where data scientists play a crucial role.</p>
        <p><strong>High Demand</strong><br>
            US Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts a 23% job growth for data scientists (2020-2030), surpassing the average.<br>
            Similar global trends indicate a surge in demand.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Lucrative Salaries</strong><br>
            Handsome rewards for expertise; US data scientists earn over $120,000 annually.<br>
            In India, experienced professionals can fetch upwards of ₹15 lakhs (USD 18,750).</p>
        
            <p><strong>Impactful Work</strong><br>
            Tangible societal impact: Develop algorithms for disease detection, optimize energy grids, or predict natural disasters.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Skills Required to Become a Data Scientist</strong><br>
            Usually, data scientists come from various educational and work experience backgrounds, and most should be proficient in, or in an ideal case be masters in four key areas.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Domain Knowledge</strong><br>
            Most people think that domain knowledge is not important in data science, but it is very important. Let’s take an example: If you want to be a data scientist in the banking sector, and you have much more information about the banking sector like stock trading, finance, etc. This is going to be very beneficial for you and the bank itself will give more preference to these types of applicants than a normal applicant.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Math Skills</strong><br>
            Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus & Optimization Techniques, are three things that are very important as they help us in understanding various machine learning algorithms that play an important role in Data Science. Similarly, understanding Statistics is very significant as this is a part of Data analysis. Probability is also significant to statistics and it is considered a prerequisite for mastering machine learning.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Computer Science</strong><br>
            There is much more to learn in computer science. But when it comes to the programming language one of the major questions that arise is:</p>
        
            <p><strong>Python or R for Data Science?</strong><br>
            There are various reasons to choose which language for Data Science as both have a rich set of libraries to implement complex machine learning algorithms, visualization, and data cleaning. Please refer to R vs Python in Data Science to know more about this. Knowing both of these languages will provide an extra boost in your career as a data scientist.</p>
        
            <p>Apart from the programming language, the other computer science skills you have to learn are:</p>
        
            <p>- Basics of Data Structure and Algorithm<br>
            - SQL<br>
            - MongoDB<br>
            - Linux<br>
            - Git<br>
            - Distributed Computing<br>
            - Machine Learning and Deep Learning, etc.</p>
            <p><strong>Communication Skills</strong><br>
                It includes both written and verbal communication. What happens in a data science project is after concluding the analysis, the project has to be communicated to others. Sometimes this may be a report you send to your boss or team at work. Other times it may be a blog post. Often it may be a presentation to a group of colleagues.</p>
            
                <p>Regardless, a data science project always involves some form of communication of the project’s findings. So it’s necessary to have communication skills for becoming a data scientist.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Learning Resources</strong><br>
                There are plenty of resources and videos available online and it’s confusing for someone where to start learning all the concepts. Initially, as a beginner, if you get overwhelmed with so many concepts then don’t be afraid and stop learning. Have patience, explore, and stay committed to it.</p>
            
                <p>Some useful learning resource links are available at GeeksforGeeks:</p>
            
                <p>- Mathematics<br>
                - Python<br>
                - R<br>
                - SQL<br>
                - Data Structure<br>
                - Machine Learning</p>
                <h2>Data Scientist vs Data Analyst</h2>
